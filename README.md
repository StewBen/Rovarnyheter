A simple Python Script (`main.py`) for running the Twitter Bot [@sosvovtot](https://twitter.com/sosvovtot).
This Bot was mainly made as a silly project for learning basic API usage along the way. It uses the Twitter API to save news-tweets from [@svtnyheter](https://twitter.com/svtnyheter) (Swedish state news source) and later post them, translated into [Rövarspråket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%B6varspr%C3%A5ket).

The code has plenty of comments and is deployed from GitHub to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), where it is scheduled to run every 10 minutes.
